# DS_functional_fmt

This document describes how should the functional implementation should be formatted.

## General

```cpp
void function() {
    // effective operations
    std::cout << std::endl;
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

Attention! `endl` should be called twice at the end of a function, but never at the beginning!
